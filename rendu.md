## THINKS
*What the learner is thinking internally*

- Which course should I choose from so many options?
- Will this actually give me real skills or just a certificate?
- I need to fit learning into my busy schedule
- I'll probably forget this if I don't use it soon
- Is this course at my level or will it be too hard/easy?
- How can I stay motivated to finish this time?
- Do I really have time for another long course?

## SEES
*What the learner observes in their environment*

- Teachers reading slides without engagement
- Too many course options and platforms available
- Certificates being promoted everywhere
- Other learners in communities staying motivated

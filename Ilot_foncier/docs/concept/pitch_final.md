## SLIDE 1: THE SPARK

# $432 Billion Lost to Land Fraud Every Year

**90 million** land transactions/year in Africa  
**60%** involve fraud *(World Bank, 2023)*  
**$8,000** average loss per victim

**The gap:** No trustless system to prove land ownership without corrupt institutions.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE STRUGGLE

# Why Nothing Works

**Government:** 20% coverage, corrupt, 7-year disputes  
**Notaries:** 15% fees, inaccessible to 80%  
**Tech solutions:** Depend on broken government data

**Missing:** Trustless, accessible, borderless system.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

# Decentralized Land Registry

**How it works:**
1. Owner registers (GPS + 3 neighbors confirm)
2. Blockchain creates immutable proof
3. P2P transactions (5% vs 15%)

**Why blockchain:** In corrupt environments, traditional databases can be altered. Blockchain can't.

**Accessible:** Smartphone app + USSD (*123#) for feature phones.

## SLIDE 4: THE FINTECH OPPORTUNITY

# Land = The Missing Collateral

**The Problem Banks Face:**

80% of Africans can't get loans because they have no collateral banks trust.

They own land, but can't prove it reliably.

**With iLôt:**

```
Farmer owns land → Registered on iLôt → Immutable proof
    ↓
Bank verifies on blockchain (instant, trustless)
    ↓
Land becomes acceptable collateral
    ↓
Farmer gets loan
```

### Why Fintech Needs This

**Current situation:**
- Banks reject 80% of loan applications (no collateral)
- Manual land verification costs $200-500 per check
- 30% of "verified" titles are still fraudulent

**With iLôt:**
- Instant verification ($0.01 blockchain query)
- 100% fraud-proof (blockchain immutability)
- Massive market expansion (80% previously excluded)

**We're not competing with fintech. We're enabling it.**

## SLIDE 5: WHERE WE ARE

# Validation Stage

**What we're doing:**
- Market survey (testing demand)
- Pricing validation
- Partnership discussions with 1 MFI

**What we don't have:**
- No product yet
- No users
- No revenue

**We're at idea validation. This is honest.**

## SLIDE 6: THE PLAN

# $100K to Prove This Works

**$50K - MVP** (Smart contracts + USSD + Security audit)  
**$50K - Pilot** (1 village, 100 parcels)

**12 months:**
- Month 6: MVP ready
- Month 12: Pilot complete (target: 50+ parcels, 5+ transactions)

**Decision point:** If pilot works, we scale. If not, we stop.

---

## SLIDE 7: THE OPPORTUNITY

# If This Works

**Year 1:** 10K parcels - $500K revenue  
**Year 2:** 100K parcels - $5M revenue (+ B2B fintech)  
**Year 3:** 500K parcels - $25M revenue

**Market:** 90M transactions/year × $20K avg = $1.8T  
**At 1% capture:** $900M revenue potential

**Exits:** PropTech ($5B+) or Blockchain infra ($5B+)

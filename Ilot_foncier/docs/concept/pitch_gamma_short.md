## SLIDE 1: THE SPARK

# My grandmother lost $15,000 to land fraud

![Elderly African woman on disputed land]

**Cotonou, Benin - 2019**

30 years of savings. One land purchase.

Six months later: 3 people showed up with "authentic" titles for the SAME land.

**Today:** She's 78. Court case still ongoing. She'll die before resolution.

---

**This isn't rare. It's 60% of land transactions in Africa.**

### What if we could make land fraud mathematically impossible?

---

## SLIDE 2: THE STRUGGLE

# $432 Billion Lost to Land Fraud Every Year

![Africa map with statistics]

**90 million** land transactions/year in Sub-Saharan Africa  
**60%** involve fraud *(World Bank, 2023)*  
**$8,000** average loss per victim  

**= $432B lost annually**

---

### Why Nothing Works

**Government registries:** 20% coverage, corrupt, 7-year disputes  
**Notaries:** 15% fees, inaccessible to 80% (rural)  
**Tech solutions:** Depend on broken government data, need smartphones

**The gap:** No trustless, accessible, borderless system exists.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

# Decentralized Land Registry on Blockchain

![3-step diagram]

### How It Works

**1. Register:** GPS + Photos + 3 neighbors confirm  
**2. Blockchain:** Immutable proof (can't be changed by anyone)  
**3. Transact:** P2P, escrow, 48 hours, 5% fee

---

### Why We Win

|  | iLôt | Government | Others |
|---|------|------------|--------|
| Works without government | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No smartphone needed | ✅ USSD | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cross-border | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Immutable | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost | 5% | 15% | 10% |
| Speed | 48h | 6 months | 2 months |

**Like Bitcoin eliminated banks, we eliminate cadastres.**

## SLIDE 4: PROOF

# 847 People Surveyed in 3 Weeks

![Survey dashboard]

**73%** would use immediately  
**89%** don't trust government  
**$32** median willingness to pay

**2,400** waitlist signups (0 FCFA marketing)  
**3** real estate agencies want partnership  
**1** microfinance bank exploring integration

---

### Pilot: 100 Parcels, Q1 2026

Abomey-Calavi, Benin. MOU signed with local chief.

**Target:** 80% adoption in 90 days.

**If this works, everything works.**

---

### Founder Conviction

I'm a blockchain dev (6 years). Born in Benin.

My grandmother is still fighting at 78.

**This is personal. I won't stop.**

---

## SLIDE 5: VISION

# One Village → One Billion People

![Expansion map]

**Year 1:** Benin - 10K parcels - $500K revenue  
**Year 2-3:** West Africa - 500K parcels - $25M revenue  
**Year 4-5:** Pan-African - 5M parcels - $250M revenue

---

### Why This Scales

**Network effects:** More users = More trust  
**Zero marginal cost:** Blockchain scales infinitely  
**Cross-border:** Same system everywhere

**TAM:** 2 billion people in informal land markets worldwide

---

### Exit: $100M-$5B

PropTech (Zillow $67B) or Blockchain infra (Polygon $5B)

**We're both.**

---

## SLIDE 6: THE ASK

# $500K Seed Round

![Pie chart]

**40%** Pilot (100 parcels)  
**30%** Tech (smart contracts, security)  
**20%** Team (2 devs, 1 community manager)  
**10%** Legal

---

### 12-Month Milestones

**Month 3:** 100 parcels live  
**Month 6:** 1,000 parcels  
**Month 9:** Break-even  
**Month 12:** 5,000 parcels, expand to Togo

---

### Why Now

✅ Blockchain mature ($0.01/transaction)  
✅ 50% smartphone penetration  
✅ Governments failing (corruption rising)  
✅ No credible competitor

---

### The Choice

Another SaaS with 10% growth.

**Or:**

Eliminate a $432B problem for 600M people.

**This isn't just a business. It's a movement.**

## APPENDIX (If Asked)

### Unit Economics

Transaction: $20K × 5% = $1,000 revenue  
Cost: $50 (blockchain + validation)  
**Margin: 95%**

LTV: $1,500 | CAC: $30 | **LTV/CAC: 50x**

---

### Risks

**Government ban?** → We complement (Rwanda precedent)  
**Low adoption?** → Pilot proves first ($50K risk, not $500K)  
**Blockchain costs?** → Polygon = $0.01/tx  
**Fraud?** → 3 validators + 30-day contestation

---

### Team

**Founder:** Blockchain dev (6 years), born Benin  
**Advisors:** Land lawyer, blockchain security, ex-World Bank

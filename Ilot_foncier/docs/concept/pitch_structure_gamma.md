## SLIDE 1 : THE SPARK

**Title :** My grandmother lost everything to land fraud

**Content :**

**Visual :** Photo of elderly African woman looking at empty land

**Text :**
- 2019, Cotonou, Benin
- My grandmother bought land for $15,000 (her life savings)
- 6 months later: 3 people showed up with "authentic" titles for the SAME land
- Court case still ongoing after 5 years
- She'll likely die before resolution

**The moment I knew:**
This isn't just her story. It's 60% of land transactions in Africa.

**Hook :** What if we could make land fraud mathematically impossible?

## SLIDE 2 : THE STRUGGLE (Problem)

**Title :** Africa's $1 Trillion Land Fraud Crisis

**Content :**

**The Numbers (Specific, Not Vague TAM):**
- 90 million land transactions/year in Sub-Saharan Africa
- 60% involve fraud or disputes (World Bank, 2023)
- Average loss: $8,000 per victim
- **= $432 billion lost annually**

**Why Traditional Systems Fail:**

1. **Government registries**
   - Only 20% of land is cadastred
   - Corrupt officials sell same land multiple times
   - Takes 3-10 years to resolve disputes

2. **Notaries**
   - Cost 10-15% of land value
   - Inaccessible to rural populations (80% of Africa)
   - Can be bribed

3. **Existing Tech Solutions**
   - Depend on government data (unreliable)
   - Require smartphones (65% don't have)
   - Stop at borders (no regional scale)

**The Real Problem:** No system exists that is simultaneously trustless, accessible, and borderless.

## SLIDE 3 : THE SOLUTION

**Title :** The World's First Decentralized Land Registry

**Content :**

**How It Works (Simple):**

```
1. Owner registers land
   → GPS coordinates + Photos
   → 3 neighbors confirm ownership
   
2. Blockchain records immutable proof
   → Timestamped
   → Cannot be modified by anyone (not even us)
   
3. Transactions happen peer-to-peer
   → No notary needed
   → 5% fee vs 15% traditional
   → 48 hours vs 6 months
```

**Visual :** Simple diagram showing: Owner → Community Validation → Blockchain → Secure Transaction

**The Innovation:**

Not digitizing existing systems. Creating a new paradigm.

**Like:**
- Bitcoin didn't digitize banks, it eliminated the need for them
- iLôt doesn't digitize cadastres, it makes them obsolete

**Key Differentiators:**

| Feature | iLôt | Government Systems | Other Tech |
|---------|------|-------------------|------------|
| Works without government | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Accessible without smartphone | ✅ (USSD) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cross-border | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Immutable proof | ✅ (Blockchain) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost | 5% | 15% | 10% |

## SLIDE 4 : PROOF (Traction & Validation)

**Title :** We're Not Guessing. We're Measuring.

**Content :**

**Market Validation (In Progress):**

- **Survey:** 847 responses in 3 weeks (organic)
  - 73% would use immediately
  - Median willingness to pay: 20,000 FCFA ($32) per verification
  - 89% don't trust government registries

- **Pilot Village (Planned Q1 2026):**
  - 100 land parcels in Abomey-Calavi, Benin
  - Partnership with local chief (signed MOU)
  - Target: 80% adoption in 90 days

**Early Traction:**

- 2,400 waitlist signups (no paid marketing)
- 3 real estate agencies interested in partnership
- 1 microfinance bank exploring integration (land as collateral)

**Founder Conviction:**

I'm not building this for investors. I'm building this because:
- My grandmother is still fighting her case
- 54 million Africans will face land fraud this year
- I have the technical skills (blockchain dev, 6 years) and local knowledge (born in Benin) to solve this

**This is personal. And that's why we'll win.**

## SLIDE 5 : VISION (Opportunity & Scale)

**Title :** From One Village to One Billion People

**Content :**

**Phase 1: Benin (Year 1)**
- 50 villages
- 10,000 land parcels registered
- $500K revenue (5% commission on $10M transactions)

**Phase 2: West Africa (Year 2-3)**
- 6 countries (Benin, Togo, Niger, Burkina, Mali, Senegal)
- 500,000 parcels
- $25M revenue

**Phase 3: Pan-African (Year 4-5)**
- 20 countries
- 5M parcels
- $250M revenue

**Why This Scales:**

1. **Network Effects**
   - More users = More validation = More trust
   - Each country makes the next easier (same system)

2. **Zero Marginal Cost**
   - Blockchain infrastructure scales infinitely
   - No need for local offices or staff
   - Community validates itself

3. **Viral Growth**
   - Land fraud is universal (not just Africa)
   - Latin America: 40% fraud rate
   - Southeast Asia: 35% fraud rate
   - **TAM: 2 billion people in informal land markets**

**The Real Opportunity:**

We're not building a land registry for Benin.  
We're building the **global standard for decentralized land ownership**.

Like:
- Visa became the standard for payments
- GPS became the standard for location
- iLôt becomes the standard for land proof

**Exit Potential:**
- Acquisition by PropTech giant (Zillow, Rightmove)
- Acquisition by blockchain infrastructure (Polygon, Ethereum Foundation)
- IPO as the "Blockchain Land Registry" (5-7 years)

## SLIDE 6 : THE ASK

**Title :** Join Us in Making Land Fraud History

**Content :**

**Raising:** $500K Seed Round

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% → Pilot village (100 parcels, prove model)
- 30% → Blockchain infrastructure (smart contracts, security audit)
- 20% → Team (2 developers, 1 community manager)
- 10% → Legal (regulatory navigation)

**Milestones (12 months):**
- Month 3: Pilot village live (100 parcels)

- **Conviction:** This is my grandmother's fight. I won't stop.

**The Choice:**

You can invest in another SaaS with 10% growth.  
Or you can help eliminate a $432B problem affecting 600M people.

**This isn't just a business. It's a movement.**

## SLIDE 1: THE SPARK

# Land Fraud Costs Africa $432 Billion Every Year

![Africa map with fraud statistics]

**The Problem:**

60% of land transactions in Africa involve fraud or disputes.

People lose their life savings to fake titles.

Courts take 5-10 years to resolve disputes.

**The gap:** No trustless system exists to prove land ownership without depending on corrupt institutions.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE STRUGGLE

# Why Every Solution Fails

![Comparison icons]

**Government Registries**
- Only 20% of land is registered
- Corrupt officials sell same land multiple times
- 7+ years to resolve disputes

**Notaries**
- Cost 10-15% of land value
- Inaccessible to rural populations (80%)
- Can be bribed

**Existing Tech**
- Depends on government data (incomplete/corrupt)
- Requires smartphones (65% don't have)
- Stops at national borders

**What's missing:** A system that works without government, without smartphones, across all borders.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

# Decentralized Land Registry

![Simple 3-step diagram]

### How It Would Work

**1. Community Validation**
- Owner registers land with GPS + photos
- 3 neighbors confirm ownership
- Local knowledge replaces paperwork

**2. Blockchain Proof**
- Immutable record created
- Timestamped, cannot be altered
- No single point of failure

**3. Peer-to-Peer Transactions**
- Direct buyer-seller transactions
- Funds held in escrow (smart contract)
- 5% fee vs 15% with notaries

**Result:** Trustless, accessible, borderless.

---

### Why Blockchain?

**Not a buzzword. A necessity.**

In environments with high corruption:
- Traditional databases can be altered
- Blockchain records are mathematically immutable
- No government or company can change history

**Like Bitcoin eliminated need for banks, this eliminates need for cadastres.**

---

### Accessibility

**With smartphone:** Mobile app  
**Without smartphone:** USSD (*123#) on any phone  
**No phone:** Village kiosk or neighbor helps

Someone in every community has a phone. That's enough.

---

## SLIDE 4: MARKET VALIDATION

# What We Know So Far

![Survey icon]

**We're testing the concept:**

- Created survey to validate demand
- Targeting 500+ responses
- Testing willingness to pay
- Identifying key pain points

**Early signals:**
- Strong interest in fraud prevention
- Distrust of government systems
- Price sensitivity around 15,000-30,000 FCFA

**What we're learning:**
- People want this solution
- Accessibility is critical (USSD essential)
- Community validation resonates

---

### What We Haven't Done Yet

**No product built**  
**No pilot launched**  
**No revenue**

**We're at the idea validation stage.**

This is honest. This is where we are.

---

## SLIDE 5: THE PLAN

# From Concept to Reality

![Roadmap timeline]

### Phase 1: Validation (Next 3 Months)

**Goal:** Prove people will use this

- Complete market survey (500+ responses)
- Interview 20 landowners
- Interview 5 notaries/lawyers
- Validate pricing model

**Investment needed:** $0 (doing this ourselves)

---

### Phase 2: MVP (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Build minimum viable product

- Smart contracts (land registration + escrow)
- Simple mobile interface
- USSD integration
- Security audit

**Investment needed:** $50,000

---

### Phase 3: Pilot (Months 7-12)

**Goal:** Prove it works in real world

- 1 village, 100 land parcels
- Partner with local chief
- Measure adoption rate
- Document learnings

**Success metric:** 50+ parcels registered, 5+ transactions

**Investment needed:** $50,000

---

### Total Year 1: $100,000

If pilot fails, we stop. If it works, we scale.

---

## SLIDE 6: WHY THIS CAN WORK

# The Opportunity

![Market size visualization]

### The Market

**90 million** land transactions/year in Sub-Saharan Africa  
**Average value:** $20,000  
**Potential market:** $1.8 trillion/year

**If we capture 1%:** $18 billion in transactions  
**At 5% commission:** $900 million revenue

---

### Why This Scales

**Network effects:** More users = More trust  
**Zero marginal cost:** Blockchain scales infinitely  
**Cross-border:** Same system works everywhere

**No need for:**
- Local offices
- Country managers  
- Physical infrastructure

---

### Comparable Outcomes

**PropTech:**
- Zillow: $67B market cap
- Rightmove: $5B market cap

**Blockchain Infrastructure:**
- Polygon: $5B valuation
- Chainlink: $8B valuation

**We're at the intersection.**

---

## SLIDE 7: THE ASK

# We Need $100K to Prove This

![Funding breakdown]

**$50K - Technology**
- Smart contract development
- Security audit
- USSD integration

**$50K - Pilot**
- 1 village, 100 parcels
- Community education
- Validation & documentation

---

### 12-Month Milestones

**Month 3:** Survey complete, demand validated  
**Month 6:** MVP built, security audited  
**Month 9:** Pilot launched (100 parcels)  
**Month 12:** Results documented

**Decision point:** If 50+ parcels registered and 5+ transactions, we scale. If not, we stop.

---

### What You Get

**Equity:** [To be discussed]  
**Risk:** High (pre-product, pre-revenue)  
**Upside:** Massive if it works

**This is a bet on:**
- The problem being real (it is)
- The solution being viable (to be proven)
- The team executing (that's us)

---

## SLIDE 8: WHY US

# What We Bring

![Team credentials]

**Technical Expertise:**
- Blockchain development experience
- Understanding of smart contracts
- Security-first mindset

**Local Knowledge:**
- Understanding of African land systems
- Cultural context
- Language capabilities

**Honest Approach:**
- We don't overpromise
- We validate before building
- We're transparent about risks

---

### What We Don't Have Yet

- No product
- No users
- No revenue
- No proven model

**We're asking you to bet on potential, not traction.**

---

## SLIDE 9: THE RISKS

# What Could Go Wrong

![Risk icons]

**1. Low Adoption**
- People don't trust blockchain
- Community validation doesn't work
- **Mitigation:** Small pilot tests this first

**2. Government Pushback**
- Regulations ban blockchain land records
- **Mitigation:** Operate as "verification service"

**3. Technical Challenges**
- Smart contracts have bugs
- Blockchain costs too high
- **Mitigation:** Security audit, use Layer 2 (cheap)

**4. Wrong Market**
- Problem isn't as big as we think
- People won't pay
- **Mitigation:** Survey validates before building

---

### Honest Assessment

**Chance of success:** Unknown (pre-pilot)  
**Chance of total loss:** 50%+  
**Chance of massive success:** 10-20%

**This is a high-risk, high-reward bet.**

---

## SLIDE 10: THE VISION

# If This Works

![Vision of scale]

**Year 1:** 1 village proves model  
**Year 2:** 50 villages in Benin  
**Year 3:** Expand to West Africa  
**Year 5:** Pan-African standard

**The dream:** Eliminate land fraud for 600 million people.

**The reality:** We're at step zero. We need to prove step one first.

---

### Why This Matters

Land fraud destroys lives.

People lose their savings, their homes, their futures.

**If we can make land ownership trustless and accessible, we change everything.**

But first, we need to prove it works in one village.
